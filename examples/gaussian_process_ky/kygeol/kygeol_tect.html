<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Alluvium</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Alluvium (Qa).—Alluvium occurs throughout Kentucky and is shown along most of the larger streams and tributaries on all three map sheen. It is particularly extensive along the Ohio River and its tributaries in western Kentucky and the Jackson Purchase. As shown on this map, alluvium also includes sediments mapped on the geologic quadrangle maps as (low) terrace and floodplain deposits, and in western Kentucky as outwash deposits. Small areas of low lying glacial deposits, such as lacustrine and eolian sediments, are also included locally. Alluvium consists of boulders, cobbles, pellets, sand, silt, and clay in various proportions; it is as much as 200 ft thick along major rivers. Most alluvium is Holocene, but some is late Pleistocene. Charcoal from alluvium near Maysville, Ky., yielded a radiocarbon age of 9,010±300 years (Gibbons and Weiss, 1972).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Continental deposits</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Continental deposits mapped separately and with loess are extensive and mappable only in far western Kentucky in the Mississippi Embayment. These map units have been described in detail and their origins discussed by Olive (1980), from which the following descriptions are taken. West of the Tennessee River (Kentucky Lake), in the Jackson Purchase region, Olive combined continental deposits and loess into a single unit, as does the State map. East of the Jackson Purchase, where loess is less widespread, continental deposits and loess are shown separately. The continental deposits consist mainly of a basal gravel grading upward into sand with interbedded silt and clay. The gravel is made up of subangular to sub-rounded chert pebbles, cobbles, and boulders with smaller amounts of rounded to well-rounded quartz and quartzite pebbles. The sand is composed dominantly of fine to coarse grains of quartz with minor amounts of chert and, locally, mica and is yellowish orange to reddish brown. Olive (1980) suggests that the continental deposits represent two periods of deposition: Miocene(?) and Pliocene deposits occur on the higher elevations, and Pleistocene deposits are inset at lower elevations. Included in the continental deposits is a sequence commonly referred to in the southeastern region as Lafayette Gravel.&quot; Potter (1955) has interpreted the &quot;Lafayette&quot; as a vast, complex Pliocene alluvial fan composed of sediments transported from a southeastern source and deposited by the ancestral Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Parts of this fan were dissected and the gravels redeposited during the Pleistocene.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Glacial drift</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Glacial drift has been mapped only along the Ohio River upstream from Louisville and is not as extensive or as thick as the outwash. Most of the deposit mapped as drift are till, but the deposit include various amounts of outwash, kame, and lacustrine deposit. The tills generally consist of gray, calcareous sandy and silty clay with angular pebbles of chert and rounded pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of quartz, quartzite, chert, and igneous and metamorphic rocks, including basalt, granite, diorite, gneiss, and schist. The till has no bedding and is unsorted, but it locally contains lenses or beds of outwash sand and gravel. The till is locally cemented with secondary calcite. Weathered horizons commonly have abundant limonite pellets or calcite concretions. Glacial drift deposits of different ages, which are as much as 100 ft thick, are distinguished by their degree of weathering (especially leaching of calcite) and their topographic position. Older drift is generally found in preglacial drainage valleys above 665 ft elevation. Exposures of older drift locally exhibit abundant stratified sand. Younger drift is assigned to the Illinoian glacial stage, the older to pre-Illinoian, within which Ray (1974) interpreted both Kansan and Nebraskan deposits. Well preserved wood in Illinoian drift near Augusta, Bracken County, Ky., has been radiocarbon dated as greater than 40,000 years old (Outerbridge and others, 1973). No till of Wisconsinan age has been found in Kentucky.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>112LAKE</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Lacustrine</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Thick outwash deposits in the Ohio River Valley dammed tributaries to the south, and lacustrine sediment were deposited in the ponded water. These lacustrine deposit are as much as 140 ft thick and consist of laminated to thin-bedded, commonly calcareous, clayey silt and silty clay. Interbeds of fine sand at the downstream margins of the deposit are interpreted as interfingering glacial outwash. Lacustrine sediments are not extensive, except for a large area southeast of Louisville. In many places, small areas of lacustrine deposit are included with alluvium on the geologic map. Most lacustrine deposits are Wisconsinan in age, but some are probably Illinoian.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>112LOSS</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Loess</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Loess composed mainly of well sorted silt and eolian deposits of very fine to medium quartzose sand in blankets, ridges, and mounds as much as 70 ft thick are locally included in glacial deposit. Loess forms a thin surficial cover over many areas, especially in western Kentucky, that are shown as Paleozoic bedrock. Thick deposits of loess, already described, occur in the Jackson Purchase.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>112LOSS</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Loess</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Loess in the Jackson Purchase region, as described by Olive (1980), consists of windblown silts assigned to three Pleistocene formations separated by unconformities marked by buried soils. The formations are the Peoria loess (Woodfordian Substage of Wisconsinan), the Roxana Silt (Altonian Substage of Wisconsinan), and the Loveland Loess (Illinoian). The Peoria Loess is characteristically pale yellowish gray and is as much as 65 ft thick along the Mississippi River. The Roxana Silt is reddish brown and contains lenses of sand in the lower part; it is as much as 20 ft. but generally is less than 5 ft thick. The Loveland Loess is grayish orange and less than 10 ft thick; it has been recognized only in small areas west of Paducah. The windblown silt was probably derived from glacial outwash in the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys to the north and west. Blankets of loess occur elsewhere in Kentucky, generally along the Ohio River, but have not been mapped systematically and are not shown separately on the geologic map.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>112OTSH</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Glacial outwash</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Glacial outwash has been mapped along the Ohio River Valley from Louisville to Vanceburg (Lewis County, Ky.). It is composed of sand, gravel, silt, and clay, with minor amounts of organic material locally. The sand consist of yellowish- to reddish-gray, very fine to coarse, subangular to well-rounded quartz with minor carbonate and chert. The sand is generally well sorted, and sand beds are commonly crossbedded. Gravel is brownish to reddish gray and consist mostly of well-rounded clasts as much as 4 in across; it is poorly to well sorted. Gravel beds are commonly crossbedded or have cut-and-fill structures. Gravels are composed mainly of clasts of carbonate rocks, chert, quartz, igneous and metamorphic rocks, and minor amount of coal. The silt and clay are yellowish to olive gray and generally occur as lenses and interbeds in sand and gravel. The outwash forms sequences as thick as 200 ft. It is generally leached of carbonate components in the uppermost few feet, and is locally cemented with calcite or limonite at lower levels. On quadrangle maps, outwash was generally assigned to the Wisconsinan, Illinoian, and pre-Illinoian stages, mainly on the basis of terrace surface elevation and degree of weathering. Outwash of Wisconsinan age is most widespread and occurs at the lowest elevations. Glacial deposits from Louisville westward to Cloverport, as well as unmapped glacial material included in alluvium (Qa) farther west, are also probably outwash of Wisconsinan age.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>123CLBN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Claiborne Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Claiborne Formation is composed of sand containing lenses of clayey silt, silty clay, and lignite. The sand is white, light gray, and brown and weathers yellowish orange to reddish brown; it is composed of well-sorted, angular to rounded, fine to medium grains of quartz and minor amount of muscovite and chert. Bedding is thin to thick, and crossbedding and cut-and-fill structures are common; in places, angular to rounded clash of clay are present. Clayey silt and silty clay are light gray to black, brown, and olive gray, and weather yellowish orange, red, and white. Dark varieties are generally lignitic, and lignite occurs locally in beds generally less than 6 ft thick. Pollen assemblages suggest freshwater deposition and a warm and humid climate (Olive, 1980, p. 3).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>123JCKS</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Jackson Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Jackson Formation consists of two facies, fine and coarse. The fine facies, composed mainly of silty day and clayey silt, grades northward and eastward into the coarse facies, a sequence of sand and lenses of silty clay. The silt and clay are olive gray to light green and light gray to black and are locally very sandy and micaceous. Some clay samples contain pumiceous glass of volcanic origin (Olive, 1980). Sand is moderate gray to light gray and brown and weathers yellowish orange to reddish brown. It is composed of fine to very coarse grains and in places contains pebbles of quartz with minor amounts of white, light-gray, yellow, and, less commonly, black chert. Angular to rounded pebbles to boulders of clay occur locally. The sand is thin to thick bedded with common crossbedding and cut-and-fill structures.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>124WLCX</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Wilcox Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Wilcox Formation, of early Eocene age, is composed of interbedded sand, clay, and silt. The sand is light gray and brown and weathers yellowish orange to reddish brown. It is composed mostly of fine to medium quartz with minor amounts of chert and muscovite and rare glauconite, biotite, and feldspar; sorting is poor. Bedding is thin to thick, and crossbedding and cut-and-fill structures are common. The sand is usually clayey or silty and in many places contains locally derived angular to rounded pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of clay. These coarse sediments occur mostly near the base of the formation in channels eroded into underlying units. &quot;Sawdust sand,&quot; the most distinctive rock type in the formation, is composed of fine to medium grains of quartz, white chart, and kaolinite which impart a speckled appearance. This lithotype is dominant in some areas and absent in others. The silty clay and clayey silt are light gray or brown to black and weather yellowish orange to white. Kaolinite and illite are the dominant clay minerals (Olive and Finch, 1969, p. 16). Marcasite and pyrite nodules are locally present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many places lignitized plant material is present, and lignite lenses occur sparsely. Palynomorph assemblages indicate freshwater deposition in a subtropical, humid to temperate climate (Olive, 1980, p. 2). The thickness of the Wilcox is extremely variable because of the irregular erosion surface on which it was deposited and because of extensive postdepositional erosion which completely removed the formation in northern and eastern areas. Paleobotanical samples of the unit indicate an early Wilcox (early Sabinian) age (Olive, 1980, p. 2).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>125CLMCU</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Clayton and McNairy Formations, undivided</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The McNairy Formation (Upper Cretaceous) and the overlying Clayton Formation (Paleocene) are combined on the map as a single unit. These two formations are separated by a regional disconformity that is marked by distinct faunal and floral changes (Tschudy, 1970). However, because of lithic similarity and poor exposures of the formational boundary, they cannot be distinguished in the field in most places. The sequence onsists mainly of light- to dark-gray, fine to medium (rarely coarse) sand that weathers to yellow or reddish brown. The sand is interbedded with gray, black, or brown clay, a few lenses of chert gravel and silt near the base, and sparse lignite. The sand, dominantly angular to subangular quartz, is generally micaceous and locally contains pebbles and cobbles of lay. Bedding ranges from thin to thick, and crossbedding and cut-and-fill structures are common. Ophiomorpha are locally abundant in the sand. Clay, commonly micaceous, occurs in fine laminae to thick beds which contain leaf imprints or marcasite concretions in many places. Sand is dominant in the south, but the clay content increases progressively northward, and near Paducah the unit is mostly clay. The basal contact is an unconformity with as much as 150 ft of relief on the underlying Tuscaloosa Formation or Paleozoic rocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paleontological evidence indicates that the McNairy Formation was deposited in a marine to freshwater deltaic environment, and predominance of freshwater over marine palynomorphs suggest that the Clayton Formation is deltaic or lacustrine (Olive, 1980). Pollen studies indicated that the climate was warm temperate to subtropical (Tschudy, 1970).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>125PRCK</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Porters Creek Clay</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Porters Creek Clay of Paleocene age is divisible into three units: interbedded sand and clay in the upper and lower parts separated by a thicker dominantly clay unit in the middle. The clay is light gray to black or brownish gray. It is characteristically faintly mottled and slightly to very sandy, and it contains fine muscovite flakes and rare glauconite, biotite, and glass shards. Typically, the clay is brittle and breaks with a conchoidal fracture. In the upper and lower units, the clay contains carbonized, silicified, and rare pyritized fragments of wood. The sand is olive gray, medium to dark gray, and bluish gray and weathers yellowish orange or reddish brown. It is composed of fine to medium, angular grains of quartz and minor amounts of muscovite, glauconite, magnetite, and other minerals. In places the sand is cemented with silica into a resistant orthequartzite. The presence of glass shards suggests a volcanic origin for part of the sediments.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>211TSCL</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Tuscaloosa Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Tuscaloosa Formation of Late Cretaceous age occurs mostly just east of the Jackson Purchase, along the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers (Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkely), where it overlies Mississippian rocks. It is composed of light-gray gravel with scattered lenses of sand, silt, and clay; sand and silt are dominantly chert. Bedding is typically indistinct, but crossbedding occurs locally. The gravel consists of rounded chert and rare ortho-quartzite clasts generally less than 4 inches in diameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The formation rests unconformably on a paleokarst surface having a local relief of about 100 ft and represents fluvial deposits in which the original bedding has been locally modified by leaching of the subjacent carbonate rocks. The unit apparently extends downdip into the subsurface no more than 3 or 4 mi, where it is overlapped by the McNairy Formation. The configuration of the unit suggests deposition in a narrow trough opening to the south (Olive, 1972, p. 4). The thickness of the Tuscaloosa ranges from 0 to 180 ft.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>317MUZY</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Mauzy Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Early Permian age of strata previously assigned to the Pennsylvanian was indicated by the discovery, after completion of the mapping project, of a few large specimens of the fusulinid Triticites sp. in a Kentucky Geological Survey core hole in western Kentucky (Douglass,1979). These strata, shown as the uppermost part of the Sturgis Formation (IPs) of Early Permian age on the columnar section for western Kentucky, have been renamed the Mauzy Formation (Pm) by Kehn and others (1982), on whom the following discussion is largely based. The rocks of the Mauzy Formation (Pm) are largely covered by loess and alluvium, so the type section is from the corehole, Gil-30, which is on file in the well sample and core library of the Kentucky Geological Survey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mauzy occurs in a single small fault block in the Rough Creek fault system. The nearest sediments of Permian age are nonmarine shales and sandstones of the Dunkard Group in the Appalachian basin of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia; these outcrops lie some 300 mi east of the Mauzy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mauzy Formation (Pm) is composed of interbedded shale, siltstone, limestone, and sandstone. Shale and siltstone, the dominant rock types, are generally calcareous and range from gray to black or green. Limestone, which constitutes about 25 percent of the formation, is generally fine grained, even bedded in beds as much as 10 ft thick, and argillaceous. The Mauzy is apparently gradational with the underlying Sturgis Formation. The base of the formation is placed at the base of a limestone sequence 390 ft below the top of the type section and separates a more calcareous section above from a more sandy and coaly section below. The top of the formation is missing owing to erosion at the type section; the thickness elsewhere in the fault block is not known. Kehn and others (1982, p. 78) estimate on the basis of structural projections that the Mauzy may be as much as 1,300 ft thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lower boundary of the Permian System cannot be precisely located. Kehn and others (1982, p. 79) arbitrarily place the boundary at the base of the Mauzy Formation, 200 ft above the Sulphur Springs coal bed of Late Pennsylvanian age and 140 ft below the Early Permian fusulinids reported in corehole Gil-30.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>321MCGC</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Conemaugh and Monongahela Formations, undivided</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Conemaugh and Monongahela Formations were extended by Phalen (1908) from Ohio and West Virginia into northeastern Kentucky, where they occur in a broad syncline south of Ashland. In their type areas in Pennsylvania, the base of the Conemaugh is placed at the top of the Upper Freeport coal bed, and the base of the overlying Monongahela Formation is placed at the base of the Pittsburgh coal bed. In Kentucky, few coal beds occur in this part of the Pennsylvanian section and those that do are thin, not persistent, and poorly exposed and cannot be correlated with any certainty. As a result, in Kentucky the base of the Conemaugh is a horizon projected about 100 ft below the Brush Creek Limestone Member of the Conemaugh Formation at about the base of persistent red shales. Because the Conemaugh and Monongahela Formations are lithologically similar and the Pittsburgh coal bed cannot be identified, the two formations are shown as a single unit on quadrangle maps and on the Geologic Map of Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Conemaugh and Monongahela Formations crop out in an area of about only 400 mi2 and have a combined thickness of about 600 ft; the upper 140 ft may be assignable to the Monongahela. The strata are characterized mainly by siltstones and shales that are various shades of red, green,and gray. The shales are commonly calcareous and contain thin beds and concretions of marine and possibly freshwater limestone. The formations also contain sandstone (subgraywacke) in channel and associated deposits as thick as 60 ft. The sandstone is very fine to coarse grained and locally contains rounded quartz pebbles as much as an inch in diameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Conemaugh contains two regionally extensive marine members, the Brush Creek Limestone and Ames Limestone Members. The limestones are argillaceous, commonly only a few feet thick, and contain brachiopods, crinoids, gastropods, and fusulinids. Locally, the Brush Creek Limestone consists of two beds as much as 30 ft apart; these beds probably correlate with the Brush Creek Member and the overlying Cambridge Limestone Member of the Conemaugh Formation in Ohio. The Ames Limestone Member is in places only a few inches thick in northeastern Kentucky and pinches out locally. Its regional disribution is illustrated by Norton and others (1979, p. 67, fig. 61).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strata of the Monongahela Formation, as previously noted, cannot be distinguished from the underlying Conemaugh strata. The Monongahela, which includes the youngest Paleozoic strata in eastern Kentucky, is poorly exposed on hilltops in the northeastern part of the State. Its uppermost beds have been removed by erosion.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>321SRGS</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Sturgis Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Sturgis Formation was named for Sturgis, Ky. (Kehn, 1973). Because the rocks are generally poorly exposed in that area and no outcrop was adequate, the type section was designated as a composite section of two core holes and a stratigraphic test hole drilled in an area 5 to 8 mi northeast of Sturgis (Kehn, 1973, figs. 3, 4). As defined, the Sturgis Formation comprises all of the strata that had been previously assigned to the Lisman and Henshaw Formations, which were abandoned. In the type area, the Sturgis Formation was reported to be as much as 2,650 ft thick. However, in a later modification of the formation, Kehn and others (1982) restricted the Sturgis to a stratigraphic thickness of 2,039 ft between the top of the No. 11 coal bed and the base of a limestone and calcareous siltstone sequence, which they assigned to the newly defined Mauzy Formation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sturgis Formation is composed of interbedded sandstone, siltstone, shale, limestone, and coal. Sandstone is the dominant rock type and makes up about 40 percent of the formation. Sandstone is commonly fine to medium grained, but locally some units such as the Anvil Rock Sandstone Member are in part coarse grained and contain a few quartz pebbles. The Anvil Rock Sandstone Member (not shown on the stratigraphic column of western Kentucky), which is as much as 110 ft thick, occurs near the base of the Sturgis Formation and locally disconformably overlies the No. 11 coal bed or other parts of the Carbondale Formation. The Dixon sandstone of Glenn (1912) occurs in the middle of the Sturgis Formation and is rarely more than 25 ft thick; it is not persistent and has not generally been traced by other geologists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Limestone, which makes up less than 5 percent of the Sturgis Formation, is more abundant in the Sturgis than in the underlying Carbondale Formation. It occurs in beds that range from a fraction of an inch to as much as 10 ft thick. Many of the thicker limestones contain abundant brachiopods, crinoid fragments, and fusulinids as well as other fossils. Several widespread marine limestones are important regional and inter-basinal marker beds. Among these are the Providence Limestone Member, the Madisonville Limestone Member, and the Carthage Limestone Member. The Providence Limestone Member consists of as many as four limestone beds in a section as much as 33 ft thick. It occurs at the base of the Sturgis Formation and commonly directly overlies the No. 11 coal bed. The Madisonville Limestone Member as described by Kehn (1973, p.B10) in the type area near Madisonville, Ky., also consists of four limestone beds in a 50-ft section; it occurs about 200 fi above the base of the Sturgis Formation. The Providence and the Madisonville are relatively widespread in parts of the Eastern Interior basin and have correlatives in other parts of the basin (Kosanke and others, 1960); they are not known to have correlatives in the Appalachian basin.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Breathitt Formation consists of heterogenous and discontinuous sequences of sandstone (mainly lithic arenite), siltstone, including thinly interbedded sandstone and shale, shale, underclay, coal, and minor limestone and ironstone beds or concretions.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>324CBDL</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Carbondale Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>As originally defined in the area of Carbondale, Ill., by Shaw and Savage (1912), the Carbondale Formation included strata from the bottom of the Murphysboro coal bed to the top of the Herrin coal bed. Lee (1916, p. 30) adopted this definition for his work in Kentucky but used the local Kentucky coal bed names, the No. 6 (Davis) coal bed for Murphysboro and the No. 11 coal bed for Herrin. This usage was retained by the U.S. Geological Survey on all quadrangle maps for western Kentucky and on the State geologic map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Illinois, the Carbondale Formation has been redefined several times since it was first described. These redefinitions include those by Weller (1940), who raised the Carbondale to a group, and by Willman and Payne (1942), who moved the boundaries of the formation to the bases of prominent sandstone units. Kosanke and others (1960) again redefined the Carbondale in Illinois to include strata between the base of the Carbondale (No. 2) coal bed (the No. 8 coal bed of Kentucky usage) and the top of the Danville (No. 7) coal bed (which is probably younger than the No. 14 coal bed of Kentucky; see fig. 18). None of these redefinitions have been accepted for use in Kentucky by either the U.S. Geological Survey or the Kentucky Geological Survey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Carbondale Formation is locally more than 400 ft thick in Kentucky and consists of siltstone, shale, and some locally prominent sandstone units. The formation contains many thin but extensive unnamed argillaceous limestone beds as well as many of the thicker and more economic coal beds of the western Kentucky coal field. The No. 11 coal bed at the top of the formation contains a distinctive clay shale parting and can be traced throughout the Eastern Interior basin. The parting, 2 to 4 in thick, is commonly light bluish gray and is referred to as the &quot;blue band.&quot; It has a pelletal or grainy structure similar to some flint clays that are alteration products of volcanic ash falls. The No. 11 coal bed is the most useful stratigraphic marker in the western Kentucky coal field and is an important datum for subsurface resource studies.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Tradewater Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Tradewater Formation was named by Glenn (1912, p. 74) for exposures along the Tradewater River in Kentucky. The formation is about 600 ft thick and extends from the top of a pebbly quartzose sandstone in the Caseyville Formation or from the base of the Bell (No. lb) coal bed to the base of the No. 6 (Davis) coal bed. The formation is composed of about equal amounts of sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain several beds of limestone as well as several economic coal beds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Siever (1957, p. 235), the sandstone units of the lower part of the Tradewater (below the Curlew Limestone Member) represent a transitional facies between the mineralogically mature ortho-quartzites of the Caseyville Formation and the clearly immature subgraywackes that occur throughout the Pennsylvanian section above the Curlew Limestone. Furthermore, these sandstones are finer grained and tend to be more sheetlike in shape than the channel-fill linear deposits of the coarser grained Caseyville sandstone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tradewater contains three beds of limestone that are of stratigraphic significance to regional and interregional correlations: the Lead Creek Limestone Member, the Curlew Limestone Member, and the Yeargins limestone member of Douglass (1979). Of these, only the Curlew is shown on the stratigraphic column for western Kentucky. The Curlew, like the other limestones, is light to medium gray, dense, and thin to thick bedded and contains abundant crinoid plates, bryozoans, corals, and fusulinids. It is the most extensive stratigraphic marker within the Tradewater Formation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lead Creek Limestone Member occurs about 100 fit above the No. 3 coal bed and has been mapped in quadrangles mostly in the eastern and northeastern parts of the western Kentucky coal field. Stratigraphic investigations since completion of the mapping project have identified the Lead Creek in the subsurface in other parts of the coal field, suggesting that it is an important marker in the lower part of the Pennsylvanian sections (Williams and others, 1982). The Limestone contains Profusulinella kentuckyensis (Douglass, 1979), the most primitive of the fusiform fusulinids yet identified in North America. The Yeargins limestone member commonly underlies the No. 6 coal bed and contains fusulinids similar to those found in the Vanport Limestone Member of the Allegheny Formation in Ohio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On some quadrangle maps, the No.6 coal bed was not identified by name or was too thin to map; on others, the No. 6 was identified by local names. In both these cases the contact between the Tradewater and overlying Carbondale Formation was compiled for the State map by T.M. Kehn and J.G. Beard, who extended the position of the No. 6 coal bed throughout the western Kentucky coal field.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>327CRBN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Corbin Sandstone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Lee Formation is characterized by massive pebbly quartzose sandstone that locally contains lenses of conglomerate with quartz pebbles as much as 2.5 inches in diameter. In the type area in Lee County, Va, near Middlesboro, Ky., the formation is commonly more then 1,600 ft thick and is about 80 percent sandstone (Campbell, 1893). The sandstone is mostly thick bedded, moderately well sorted, and fine to coarse grained. Sandstone units are interpreted to be fluviatile because they are commonly fining-upward, crossbedded, channel-form deposits that contain mineralized or coalified plant remains such as ancient logjams at their bases. The Lee Formation has been described in detail by Rice (1984).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the outcrop belt along the Pottsville Escarpment, the name &quot;Lee&quot; has been applied generally to resistant, massive, cliff-forming, quartzose sandstone, but actual usage has varied from place to place. As originally described by Campbell (1898), all Pennsylvanian strata below the top of the Corbin Sandstone Member along the escarpment were assigned to the Lee Formation. In the early part of the mapping project, geologists attempted to adapt Campbell's nomenclature to the different stratigraphic conditions of their map areas. Thus, in some reports the contact between the Lee and Breathitt Formations was placed at the top of the Corbin, while in other reports it was placed at the top of the highest resistant quartzose sandstone. Where the Corbin or another resistant sandstone used as the formational boundary pinched out, geologists either projected the boundary or dropped the contact to a quartzose sandstone at a lower stratigraphic level. Locally, the boundary between the two formations was projected at the base of a coal bed that was more conveniently mapped than the top of a sandstone. In some reports where boundaries could not be projected, strata were designated &quot;Lee and Breathitt Formations, undivided.&quot; Because detailed mapping showed the Lee and Breathitt Formations to intertongue and intergrade along the western margin of the Cumberland Plateau, the name &quot;Lee Formation&quot; was ultimately restricted to previously named sandstone members of the Lee that were shown by mapping to have regional extent (Weir and Mumma, 1973). These members, from oldest to youngest the Rockcastle Sandstone (IPlr), and the Corbin Sandstone (IPlc), are shown separately on the geologic map. The younger Grayson sandstone bed of Whittington and Ferm (1967) was included locally in the Lee in northeastern Kentucky on quadrangle maps but is included with the Breathitt Formation on the State map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Livingston Conglomerate occupies two south-trending channels on the geologic map (see also fig. 17). The map also shows that the Rockcastle Sandstone pinches out to the northwest and the Corbin Sandstone pinches both to the southeast and the northwest. In northeastern Kentucky, the Corbin is largely in the subsurface but as the result of local structure is exposed in two inliers northeast of Paintsville, Ky.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Caseyville Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Caseyville Formation was named for exposures of massive cliff-forming, crossbedded, pebbly sandstone on the Ohio River near Caseyville, just north of the mouth of the Tradewater River (Owen, 1856). At the type locality, the Caseyville is a channel deposit that occupies the broad Evansville paleovalley of Potter and Desborough (1965). The valley, which is as much as 15 mi wide and 250 ft deep, has been traced in the subsurface by Bristol and Howard (1971, fig. 4) for about 130 mi across Kentucky and Indiana. At the type section, about 10 mi northwest of Caseyville, Lee (1916) described the Caseyville as a formation about 500 ft thick that includes pebbly quartzose sandstone, carbonaceous and calcareous shale, limestone, and coal. Lee placed the top of the Caseyville at the top of a massive pebbly to conglomeratic sandstone that is about 80 ft thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the sandstone units of the Caseyville Formation are persistent: some sandstone units are terminated at the walls of the paleovalleys, and others pinch out or grade into siltstone (Potter and Desborough, 1965, fig. 6). As a result, the Caseyville varies greatly in thickness and lithology from place to place. Thus, the top of the Caseyville is mapped locally in the western part of the western Kentucky coal field at the base of the Bell (or No. lb) coal bed because that coal is in places only a few tens of feet above pebbly Caseyville sandstone, but in most other parts of the basin where the Bell coal bed does not persist or cannot be identified owing to poor exposures, the Caseyville has been combined on the quadrangle maps with the overlying Tradewater Formation. On the State geologic map, the contact at the top of the Caseyville in most areas of the western Kentucky coal field is approximately located by projection of the horizon of the Bell coal bed from overlying and underlying units, such as the Lead Creek or Curlew Limestone Members of the Tradewater Formation or the top of the Mississippian, all of which were identified in drill hole logs by T.M. Kehn and J.G. Beard.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Lee Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Lee Formation is characterized by massive pebbly quartzose sandstone that locally contains lenses of conglomerate with quartz pebbles as much as 2.5 inches in diameter. In the type area in Lee County, Va, near Middlesboro, Ky., the formation is commonly more then 1,600 ft thick and is about 80 percent sandstone (Campbell, 1893). The sandstone is mostly thick bedded, moderately well sorted, and fine to coarse grained. Sandstone units are interpreted to be fluviatile because they are commonly fining-upward, crossbedded, channel-form deposits that contain mineralized or coalified plant remains such as ancient logjams at their bases. The Lee Formation has been described in detail by Rice (1984).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rocks of the Lee Formation are exposed in three major outcrop belts: in steeply dipping beds along Cumberland Mountain and Pine Mountain (IPMI), and along the western side of the Cumberland Plateau. Also, isolated outcrops of Lee sandstone occur in highly folded and sheared masses along and just northwest of the trace of the Pine Mountain over-thrust fault as part of the lower (autochthonous) plate of the fault. The sandstone members of the Lee are resistant and generally form prominent hogbacks at or near the crests of Cumberland and Pine Mountains and, in that area, make up two other prominent ridges: Rocky Face Mountain northeast of Middlesboro and White Mountain north of Pineville. Lee sandstone units also cap the Pottsville Escarpment along the western side of the Cumberland Plateau.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the type area, which is part of the Cumberland Mountain outcrop belt in Lee County, Va. And adjacent parts of Kentucky, the Lee is divided into eight members. These are, in ascending order, the Pinnacle Overlook, Chadwell, White Rocks Sandstone, Dark Ridge, Middlesboro, Hensley, Bee Rock Sandstone, and Naese Sandstone Members (Englund, 1964). The Dark Ridge and Hensley Members are mostly shale, siltstone, thin-bedded silty sandstone, and coal; the Hensley also locally contains beds of conglomeratic quartzose sandstone. The other members are dominantly sandstone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Cumberland Mountain outcrop belt, the earliest quadrangle maps tentatively placed the base of the Pennsylvanian at the base of strata equivalent to the Chadwell Member (Englund and others, 1961). Englund (1979) later showed that both the Chadwell and White Rocks Members intertongue with marine strata of Mississippian age and placed the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian systemic boundary at the top of the White Rocks or at the base of the overlying Dark Ridge Member.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Pine Mountain outcrop belt, members of the Lee Formation below the Middlesboro are commonly not identified on the quadrangle maps and the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary is generally placed at the base of the Middlesboro or, as previously noted, in the upper part of the Pennington Formation where that unit locally contains Pennsylvanian strata (see stratigraphic column, at the eastern end of the geologic map). Those Pennington strata of Pennsylvanian age are correlated in the Cumberland Mountain outcrop belt with strata of the Dark Ridge Member of the Lee Formation, which also underlie the Middlesboro Member (Rice, 1984, fig. 11).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the outcrop belt along the Pottsville Escarpment, the name &quot;Lee&quot; has been applied generally to resistant, massive, cliff-forming, quartzose sandstone, but actual usage has varied from place to place. As originally described by Campbell (1898), all Pennsylvanian strata below the top of the Corbin Sandstone Member along the escarpment were assigned to the Lee Formation. In the early part of the mapping project, geologists attempted to adapt Campbell's nomenclature to the different stratigraphic conditions of their map areas.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>upper Chesterian rocks</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>This unit, about 700 ft. thick in the fluorspar district of western Kentucky, thins to the east and is locally absent on the eastern margins of the Western Kentucky Coal Field because of pre-Pennsylvanian erosion and channeling. The fluorspar district of western Kentucky and southern Illinois is the type area for most of the formations that constitute the upper Chesterian rocks. Many of these formations become indistinguishable in central Kentucky and are mapped as the Buffalo Wallow or Leitchfield Formations. These rocks are approximately equivalent to the Pennington Formation of south-central Kentucky and Tennessee.&lt;br&gt;Along the Ohio River in western Kentucky, the upper rocks of Chesterian age include the following formations, in ascending order: Tar Springs Sandstone, Vienna Limestone, Waltersburg Sandstone, Menard Limestone, Palestine Sandstone, Clore Limestone, Degonia Sandstone, Kinkaid Limestone, and Grove Church Shale. The top of this sequence of terrigenous and carbonate sedimentary rocks is an erosional unconformity below the Caseyville Formation of Pennsylvanian age. The base of this sequence is unconformable on the Glen Dean Limestone.&lt;br&gt;The Tar Springs Sandstone consists of about 100 ft. of fine-grained, thin-bedded sandstone and silty shale containing siderite nodules. The Vienna Limestone is a distinctive cherty, skeletal limestone that is normally about 15 ft. thick. Dark, fine- grained, carbonaceous sandstone and shale with siderite nodules make up the Waltersburg Sandstone, which is generally about 25 to 45 ft. thick and resembles the upper part of the Tar Springs. The Menard Limestone is composed of several layers, 15 to 45 ft. thick, of dark argillaceous skeletal limestone separated by somewhat thinner zones of calcareous, fossiliferous shale and siltstone. The Menard is commonly 100 to 140 ft thick and is overlain by 30 to 90 ft. of sandstone, siltstone, and shale assigned to the Palestine Sandstone. The lower portion of the Palestine is predominantly fine-grained, calcareous sandstone, while the upper portion is carbonaceous and sideritic silty shale. The Clore Limestone resembles the interlayered limestone and shale of the Menard Limestone and is about 100 ft. thick. The Degonia Sandstone is about 10 to 30 ft. of dark, fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and minor amounts of limestone. The Kinkaid Limestone is about 160 ft. thick and is divided into three informal members: a basal skeletal limestone member with numerous gastropods and the brachiopod Spirifer increbescens; a middle member of calcareous, fine-grained sandstone and silty shale overlain by skeletal and dolomitic limestone and succeeded by red and green shale; and an upper member of light-gray, cherty, very fossiliferous, skeletal limestone.&lt;br&gt;South of the Western Kentucky Coal Field and to the east of Muhlenberg County, the upper rocks of Chesterian age are thinner and include more shale and siltstone than in the fluorspar district of western Kentucky. In this area, these rocks have been combined as the Leitchfield Formation (see Chesterian correlation diagram), which is mostly shale and siltstone with minor sandstone and limestone. Pre-Pennsylvanian erosion has removed portions and, farther east, locally all of the Leitchfield.&lt;br&gt;In the northern part of west-central Kentucky, the Tar Springs Sandstone succeeds the Glen Dean Limestone. The overlying Mississippian rocks are mapped as the Buffalo Wallow Formation, which is composed of shales and siltstones with lesser sandstone and limestone beds. The most prominent limestones and sandstones have locally been mapped as members: the Vienna Limestone Member at the base, the Palestine Sandstone Member, and the Kinkaid Limestone Member at the top (see Chesterian correlation diagram).&lt;br&gt;The upper part of the rocks of Chesterian age includes more terrigenous rocks than the lower part; this feature is interpreted as indicating the progradation of deltaic and coastal sediments across the shelf from the north. The limestone, shale, and siltstone of this map unit weather to form a thick soil cover and are rarely exposed. The sandstone form steeper slopes than do the lower Chesterian rocks, and thinner, sandy soils with numerous outcrops. Some faults in southwest-central Kentucky are overlapped by unfaulted Pennsylvanian Caseyville Sandstone, indicating Late Mississippian or Early Pennsylvanian tectonic activity before deposition of basal Pennsylvanian sediments.</TD>

It ranges from 0 to 50 ft. in thickness, thinning northward in Rockcastle County. The Hartselle contains a minor amount of fine-grained, quartzose sandstone, especially at the base, where it is in erosional contact with the Kidder Limestone Member, and is mostly sandstone near the Kentucky-Tennessee State line (Lewis and Thaden, 1966).  The Hartselle Formation is generally poorly exposed, except where it includes a thick sandstone unit, and commonly forms a soil-covered bench above the Kidder Limestone Member.</TD>

The lower contact is placed at a breccia, locally silicified, at the top of the Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member, which lies above the highest occurrence of Platycrinites penicillus. A distinctive limestone with abundant large crinoid columnals occurs in the upper third of the Kidder Limestone Member and may be equivalent to the Beech Creek Limestone Member of the Golconda Formation of western Kentucky; the upper part of the Kidder Limestone Member may be equivalent to the Haney Limestone Member of the Golconda.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Newman Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>In east-central and northeastern Kentucky, the limestone and minor sandstone and shale above the Borden Formation and below the Pennsylvanian Breathitt or Lee or Mississippian Pennington Formation has been mapped as the Upper Mississippian Newman Limestone (now part of the Slade Formation). The formation can be traced in the subsurface to the Pine Mountain overthrust fault in southeastern Kentucky. It is equivalent to the Bangor Limestone, Hartselle Formation, Monteagle Limestone, and upper part of the St. Louis Limestone of south-central Kentucky (Lewis and others, 1973) and is roughly equivalent to the Greenbrier Limestone of Virginia and West Virginia. In northeasternmost Kentucky, the Carter Caves Sandstone is included with the Newman on the geologic map.&lt;br&gt;The Newman Limestone is divided into two parts, a lower part consisting of the St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve Limestone Members and an informal upper member (Hatch, 1964). The St. Louis Limestone Member, as much as 80 ft. or so of light-gray, fine-grained limestone with some chert and abundant corals, is correlative with the upper part of the St. Louis Limestone of south-central Kentucky. The contact with the overlying Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member is a disconformity with several feet of relief, and marked by black silicified breccia at the top of the St. Louis, in north-eastern and east-central Kentucky, but it is confomtable in Rockcastle County (Ettensohn and others, 1984, p. 8, 9). The St. Louis Limestone Member thins to the northeast because of pre-Ste. Genevieve erosion and occurs as discontinuous bodies as far north as Greenup County (Sharps, 1966).&lt;br&gt;The Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member of the Newman Limestone consists of as much as 100 ft. of oolitic and skeletal limestone, the lower part of which is equivalent to the Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member of the Monteagle Limestone in south-central Kentucky. A crossbedded, sandy limestone, now known as the Warix Run Member of the Slade Formation, is common at the top of the Ste. Genevieve in east-central Kentucky (Hoge, 1977; Ettensohn and others, 1984). The Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member unconformably overlies the St. Louis Limestone Member in much of this area, and locally directly overlies the upper units of the Borden Formation; it is absent in much of northeastern Kentucky (Hylbert and Philley, 1971; Philley and Chaplin, 1976; see Dever, 1980 for a detailed discussion of the distribution of these units).&lt;br&gt;The upper part of the Newman Limestone consists of as much as 140 ft. of limestone and minor shale. The limestones are fine- to coarse-grained, predominantly skeletal and very fossiliferous, and locally oolitic and crossbedded. They are interbedded with thin, green clay shales and argillaceous limestone. These rocks are correlated with the Kidder Limestone Member of the Monteagle Limestone, Hartselle Formation, and Bangor Limestone of south-central Kentucky. The upper part of the Newman thins to the northeast, partly owing to pre-Pennsylvanian erosion. The contact with the overlying Pennington Formation is conformable, and thin equivalents of the Hartselle Formation and the Bangor Limestone have locally been included in the Pennington Formation (Hatch, 1964). In the vicinity of Carter and Rowan Counties, as much as 90 ft. of well-sorted, fine-grained, crossbedded quartzose sandstone with numerous fossils, the Carter Caves Sandstone, intertongues with the upper part of the Newman Limestone and the Pennington Formation (Englund and Windolph, 1971). This sandstone occurs as a discrete, northeast-trending, elongate body.&lt;br&gt;Because of the tenuous correlation of strata along the Pottsville (Cumberland) Escarpment with the Newman Limestone as mapped in the type area of Cumberland Mountain in Virginia and southeasternmost Kentucky, the name &quot;Newman&quot; as used on the State map has now been restricted from use in central and eastern Kentucky. The part of the Newman Limestone that is largely carbonate has been reassigned to the newly defined Slade Formation; the upper clastic unit of the Newman Limestone, locally called the Pennington or Pennington (?) Formation, together with all overlying strata of Mississippian age, have been reassigned to the newly defined Paragon Formation (Ettensohn and others, 1984). The new Slade Formation comprises 12 members and 1 bed, including, in ascending order, the Renfro, St. Louis, Ste. Genevieve, Warix Run, and Mill Knob Members, the Cave Branch Bed, and the Armstrong Hill, Holly Fork, Rosslyn, Tygarts Creek, Ramey Creek, Maddox Branch, and Poppin Rock Members.&lt;br&gt;The Newman Limestone records deposition on a shallow-marine carbonate shelf. The formation thins sharply and is locally absent in the area north of the Kentucky River Fault system. Features that are interpreted to result from subaerial exposure and erosion suggest tectonic uplift north of this fault zone relative to a downwarping basin to the south (Dever and others, 1977). The Carter Caves Sandstone may have been an offshore or barrier bar parallel to the shoreline on this shelf.&lt;br&gt;The Newman Limestone is largely absent along the Ohio River in northeastern Kentucky owing to pre-Pennsylvanian erosion. Isolated bodies of Newman Limestone occur as far north as northeastern Greenup County (Sharps, 1966). Where present to the south, the limestone beds of this unit, as well as the Carter Caves Sandstone, tend to form cliffs and steep slopes; some caves and sinkholes have formed on the limestone terrain.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Pennington Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>In south-central Kentucky, some 200 ft. of shale with minor amounts of sandstone and limestone overlie the Bangor Limestone and have been referred to the Pennington Formation after lithologically similar rocks along the Pine Mountain overthrust in southeastern Kentucky, of which they were considered an extension. This unit thins north-eastward along the outcrop belt.&lt;br&gt;Because of the uncertainty of assignment of these strata as Pennington Formation, the name &quot;Pennington&quot; has been restricted from use in central Kentucky, and the Upper Mississippian strata that are dominantly shale and previously were assigned to either the Newman Limestone or the Pennington or Pennington (?) Formation have been reassigned to the Paragon Formation (Ettensohn and others, 1984).&lt;br&gt;The Pennington Formation is composed primarily of greenish-gray and reddish-brown clay shale, with beds of fine- to medium-grained, crossbedded, fossiliferous limestone in the lower part and siltstone and fine-grained quartzose sandstone in the upper part. Dolomite beds occur in the lower and upper parts of the Pennington in south-central and east-central Kentucky (G.R. Dever, Jr., oral communication, 1982). The basal contact is sharp but normally poorly exposed, while the upper contact is unconformable with overlying sandstone or dark-gray silty shale of the Pennsylvanian Breathitt Formation. The contacts have generally been located on changes in slope morphology, and minor differences in thickness shown from place to place probably are not significant or necessarily real.&lt;br&gt;The lithologic similarity of the Pennington Formation of south-central Kentucky to the Pennington Formation of Cumberland Mountain in southeastern Kentucky has been considered sufficient to warrant the correlation of these two units across the Cumberland Plateau; they probably are not coeval (Englund, 1968, p. 12). The Pennington Formation of south-central Kentucky is traditionally correlated with the upper rocks of Chesterian age of western Kentucky, although the nature of the upper contact, and hence the youngest age of the Pennington, is not known. The formation was deposited in a variety of shallow-marine environments.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Rocks included in this map unit overlie Lower Mississippian detrital rocks and record a major shift in sedimentary environments from basinal and deltaic to shallow-marine carbonate near the end of Early Mississippian time. The Muldraugh and Renfro Members are uppermost units of the Borden Formation, where as the Fort Payne Formation overlies the Borden Formation along the delta front and the Chattanooga Shale elsewhere. The lower contact of unit Mbf is marked by a thin layer of glauconite and phosphatic nodules, which indicate a hiatus in sedimentation (Peterson and Kepferle, 1970). The upper contact is gradational and in places intertonguing with Lower and Upper Mississippian limestone, dolomite, and shale. In northeastern Kentucky, where this map unit (here the Renfro Member) is too thin to show separately, it is included with the detrital members of the Borden Formation. The Fort Payne and Muldraugh are Early Mississippian in age and the Renfro is Early and Late Mississippian. Rocks forming this map unit commonly have many small caverns and sinkholes and are overlain by cherty soils.&lt;br&gt;The Fort Payne Formation and the Muldraugh and Renfro Members of the Borden Formation crop out over much of south-central Kentucky. The Fort Payne Formation occurs in the subsurface below most of the western Kentucky coal field and a small portion of the Cumberland Plateau along the Tennessee border.

It is a very fine-grained, somewhat cherty, argillaceous and dolomitic limestone with some beds of skeletal limestone, formed on a shallow-marine shelf, and is characterized by the corals Acrocyathus proliferus and A. floriformis (Lithostrotion proliferum and Lithostrotionella castelnaui of earlier reports) in the lower part. The lower contact is rarely exposed, and the underlying Salem Limestone, part of which is lithologically similar to the St. Louis, is included with this map unit in western Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;The Salem Limestone in this area is about 120 ft. thick and is composed of dark-gray, crossbedded skeletal limestone and fine-grained argillaceous limestone with some oolitic limestone at the top. &lt;br&gt;A 10- to 20-ft.-thick zone of extremely cherty limestone occurs near or at the top of the St. Louis Limestone in western Kentucky. The overlying Ste. Genevieve Limestone is from 190 to 320 ft. thick and is divided into three members. The basal Fredonia Limestone Member, thickest of the three, is a very light gray, crossbedded and massive, oolitic to skeletal limestone characterized by the crinoid Platycrinites. The overlying Rosicliare Sandstone Member (equivalent to the Aux Vases Sandstone in Illinois) is composed of calcareous sandstone and shale, and the Levias Limestone Member (equivalent to the Levias Limestone Member of the Renault Limestone in Illinois) is an oolitic to skeletal limestone similar to the Fredonia. The top of the Ste. Genevieve Limestone is placed below the sandy and silty fine-grained limestone of the Renault Limestone. The rocks of the Ste. Genevieve formed as sandbars and shoals on a shallow-marine shelf, which supported an abundant fauna.&lt;br&gt;Near the boundary between Trigg and Christian Counties, the contact between Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis Limestones differs by about 275 ft. stratigraphically, as indicated in the stratigraphic diagram of Meramecian rocks (left side of physiographic diagram). To the east, the top of the St. Louis is placed above the uppermost beds containing abundant acrocyathid corals (Ulrich and Klemic, 1966). This zone occurs near the cherty limestones, which to the west separate the upper and lower parts of the St. Louis. The expanded Ste. Genevieve is as much as 500 ft. thick, while the restricted St. Louis is about 400 ft. thick.&lt;br&gt;The Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis Limestones extend eastward around the western Kentucky coal field with little change in character, although no members of the Ste. Genevieve are recognized. The contact with the Salem and Warsaw Limestones is placed at the base of fine-grained limestone of the St. Louis, while the top of the Ste. Genevieve Limestone is placed at the highest occurrence of the crinoid Platycrinites penicillus. The Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis Limestones are combined in geologic quadrangle maps north of Hart County (Moore, 1972) (see generalized correlation diagram of Meramecian rocks). The Lost River Chert of Elrod (1899), used locally as an informal map unit, is a conspicuous zone of highly fossiliferous, blocky chert about 10 to 20 ft above the uppermost acrocyathid corals.&lt;br&gt;In south-central Kentucky, the Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis Limestones are thinner and are divided at a zone of a calcarenite-cemented chert. “breccia” (conglomerate). The St. Louis Limestone includes 70 to 160 ft. of very fine-grained limestone, dolomite, and fossiliferous siltstone. The overlying 30 to 90 ft. of oolitic, skeletal limestone, designated the Ste. Genevieve Limestone Member of the Monteagle Limestone (Lewis, 1971), includes at the top a thin zone of indistinct silicified breccia, informally called the Bryantsville Breccia of Patton (1949), near the uppermost occurrence of Platycrinites penicillus. The St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve thin to the northeast, owing partly to the incorporation of the lower dolomitic portion of the St. Louis Limestone into the Renfro Member of the Borden Formation and partly to an unconformity at the top of the St. Louis.&lt;br&gt;The Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis Limestones underlie a broad karst plain covered by sinkholes and thick red soils and famed for the extensive Mammoth Cave-Flint Ridge cave system. The contacts and faults shown on geologic quadrangle maps were in many places based on chert residuum, subsurface data, or projections from other strata.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Salem, Warsaw, and Harrodsburg Limestones</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>These rocks, which crop out from Simpson and Allen Counties in west-central Kentucky along the Tennessee border northward to Jefferson County and eastward to Pulaski and Rockcastle Counties, generally are 80 to 160 ft. thick but thin to less than 40 ft. to the east. They include units equivalent to the Salem and Warsaw Limestones of western Kentucky and the Warsaw Limestone of Tennessee and are equivalent to the Salem Limestone and the upper part of the Harrodsburg Limestone of Indiana (Pryor and Sable, 1974; Rice, Sable, and others, 1979). In central Kentucky, east of Rockcastle County, lateral equivalents are included in the Renfro Member of the Borden Formation.&lt;br&gt;The Salem and Warsaw Limestones and the Harrodsburg Limestone are the southern and northern units, respectively, of the lowermost Upper Mississippian strata east of the Western Kentucky Coal Field (fig. 11). (The Salem and Warsaw Limestones are treated as a single stratigraphic unit where the Harrodsburg is not present). This interval everywhere includes a small portion of the Lower Mississippian at the base. The Salem and Warsaw (combined) occur in Kentucky south of Taylor, Casey, and Lincoln Counties and in the subsurface of the southern part of the Western Kentucky Coal Field. The Salem Limestone and the Harrodsburg Limestone occur north of these counties and in the northern part of the subsurface of the western Kentucky coal field (Sable and others, 1966) and continue into southern Indiana. The boundary between these interfingering northern and southern units is arbitrarily drawn. To the east in Lincoln and Pulaski Counties, the lower part of the Salem and Warsaw Limestones interfingers with the Science Hill Sandstone Member of the Warsaw (Lewis and Taylor, 1979).&lt;br&gt;The Harrodsburg and Warsaw Limestones record the shallowing that followed the basin-filling Fort Payne and Borden Formations. The Harrodsburg Limestone is a light-gray crossbedded, cherty skeletal limestone containing numerous fossils, including the brachiopods Warsawia lateralis and Marginirugus magnus. The Harrodsburg Limestone normally is 40 to 70 ft. thick and slightly dolomitic in the lower part, but it can be distinguished from the underlying Muldraugh Member of the Borden Formation where it overlies those darker dolomitic siltstones and from the darker shales and limestones of the overlying Salem Limestone. The Harrodsburg Limestone resembles the limestone bodies in the Fort Payne and Borden Formations, but it has more calcite cement and less argillaceous matrix than those deeper water, slope-deposited crinoidal limestones. The Harrodsburg thins and disappears below the Science Hill Sandstone Member in central Kentucky and into the basal portion of the Salem and Warsaw Limestones in west-central Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;The Warsaw Limestone in west- and south-central Kentucky is a mixture of argillaceous, crossbedded skeletal limestone and dark, dolomitic siltstone and shale. It contains the brachiopod Warsawia lateralis and was deposited in shallow marine water that was more turbid than that of the Harrodsburg Limestone. In west- and south-central Kentucky, the Warsaw Limestone cannot everywhere be differentiated from the Salem Limestone and is, therefore, combined with the Salem into a single map unit, the Salem and Warsaw Limestones. This combined unit consists of argillaceous limestone and limy shale at the top and the base, and dolomitic siltstone and shale in the middle.&lt;br&gt;</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Warsaw Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Warsaw Limestone of Trigg and Lyon Counties and adjacent areas of western Kentucky is a light-gray, coarse-grained, largely crinoidal-bryozoan limestone, about 150-300 ft thick, which crops out mainly along the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. It overlies the Fort Payne Formation, is overlain by the Salem Limestone, and is correlated with the Ullin and Harrodsburg Limestones of southern Illinois and west-central Kentucky (Pryor and Sable, 1974; Rice, Sable, and others, 1979). It may be equivalent to the lower part of the Salem and Warsaw Limestones of south-central Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;The Warsaw Limestone in western Kentucky is commonly cherty and argillaceous at its base; this lower part is similar to but coarser grained than limestone of the Fort Payne Formation (Hays, 1964). The remainder of the Warsaw Limestone is composed of crossbedded, skeletal limestone with scattered chert nodules and abundant fossils. It is the basal Meramecian unit of western Kentucky and contains the brachiopod Warsawia (formerly Spirifer) lateralis, the bryozoan Fenestrella, and spines of the echinoids Echinocrinus and Melonechinus. The Warsaw Limestone of western Kentucky was deposited on a shallow-marine shelf and in troughs within this shelf. The Warsaw, like most of the Upper Mississippian limestones of western Kentucky, is poorly exposed and is identified principally by a thick, reddish-brown, cherty soil.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Borden Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The sequence of the Farmers Member of the Borden Formation,Sunbury Shale, Berea Sandstone, and Bedford Shale which occurs only in northeastern Kentucky, marks a transition from the widespread deposition of Devonian black shale (Ohio Shale) to coarser clastics of the basin margin. The Bedford Shale consists of gray or greenish-gray shale with sparse to abundant, very thin siltstone beds, calcareous concretions, and pyritic nodules. The formation thins westward, pinches out in the Olympia quadrangle (McDowell and Weir, 1977), and intertongues eastward with the Berea Sandstone (Morris and Pierce, 1967). The Berea, which in most places overlies the Bedford Shale but is not as extensive, is composed of very fine grained, light-gray quartzose sandstone in thin to thick tabular beds. The Sunbury Shale is a black carbonaceous shale that is lithologically identical to the Ohio Shale; these two units cannot be distinguished on lithologic basis beyond the pinch-out of the intervening Bedford Shale and are combined as the New Albany Shale. The Farmers Member of the Borden Formation is made up of alternating beds of light-gray, very fine grained sandstone and gray shale; a persistent bed of shale at the base of the formation is known as the Henley Bed. One of the sandstone beds of the Farmers Member extends to the southwest many miles beyond the others and is known as the Clay City Bed of the Nancy Member of the Borden Formation.&lt;br&gt;The Wildie, Nada, Halls Gap, Holtsclaw Siltstone, Cowbell, Nancy, Kenwood Siltstone, and New Providence Shale Members of the Borden Formation are a sequence of siltstone and shale that becomes coarser grained upward from the shale of the New Providence Shale Member and the Nancy Member at the base to the siltstone of the Cowbell, Wildie, and Halls Gap Members and the Holtsclaw Siltstone Member. The transition from finer to coarser grained is gradational over the entire sequence, and in most cases boundaries between members can be only approximately located. The lower contact with black shale of the Chattanooga, New Albany, or Sunbury Shales or sandstone of the Farmers Member of the Borden Formation is generally sharp.&lt;br&gt;Fine-grained detrital rocks of the Borden Formation and equivalent units are widespread in the east-central United States. In Kentucky they crop out from the northeastern corner of the State, along the Ohio River where the formation is about 500 ft. thick, southwestward and westward to Somerset and Louisville. These rocks thin abruptly and may pinch out locally between the Chattanooga Shale and the Fort Payne Formation along a narrow zone that extends from just west of Louisville southeastward to Somerset (fig. 11). This zone, described as a Borden deltaic front by Peterson and Kepferle (1970) marks the southwesternmost advance of most of the detrital rocks of the Borden Formation. A thin, green shale about 1 to 2 ft. thick is present at the base of the Fort Payne Formation throughout a large portion of south-central Kentucky; it may be a distal extension of the New Providence Shale Member of the Borden Formation. This shale is mapped with the Fort Payne. Borden detrital units extend beneath younger rocks of the Cumberland Plateau and are present along and south of the Pine Mountain overthrust fault as shale, siltstone, and sandstone of the Grainger Formation. Correlative strata are recognized in Ohio as part of the Logan Formation, and in Indiana and Illinois, where they constitute the Borden Formation of that area.&lt;br&gt;The Sunbury Shale is remarkably uniform in thickness throughout its area of distribution. The Bedford Shale and coarser clastic units, the Berea Sandstone and the Farmers Member, are thickest at the northern end of their outcrop belts, along the Ohio River in Lewis County, and thin to pinch-outs southward and westward. The sandstone beds of the Farmers Member range from a few inches to several feet in thickness and are thickest near the base. The sandstone beds progressively thin upward, and intervening shale beds thicken correspondingly. These sandstone beds are interpreted as turbidite deposits on the basis of morphology and internal features (Moore and Clarke, 1970). Abrupt eastward pinch-outs of these beds along the Ohio River in northeastern Lewis County may represent a proximal margin of the turbidite sequence.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Fort Payne Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Fort Payne Formation is as much as 660 ft. thick in south-central and western Kentucky, where it overlies the Chattanooga Shale. Gray to black dolomitic siltstone and cherty, dolomitic limestone of the Fort Payne were deposited as basin fill adjacent to and southeast of the Borden deltaic sediments. The Fort Payne thins northward to 150 to 300 ft. in central Kentucky, where it is more silty, shaly, and dolomitic and less siliceous. Two northwest-trending carbonate bodies, composed primarily of crinoid debris, occur within the Fort Payne (map units “ls” in south–central Kentucky, including the Cane Valley Limestone Member of Fort Payne Formation as shown on figure 11). These crossbedded crinoidal limestones drop stratigraphically to the southwest. North and east of these limestones a calcareous sandstone body, the Knifley Sandstone Member of the Fort Payne Formation, trends subparallel to the limestone bodies and also drops in the section to the southwest (shown as map unit “Mfk” in south–central Kentucky, and in figure 11). The Knifley Sandstone and Cane Valley Limestone Members occur at or just south west of the Borden prodelta front, where the Fort Payne Formation thins as it onlaps the Borden clastics.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Muldraugh Member of the Borden Formation also overlies Borden detrital rocks; it is considered to be a thinned lateral equivalent of the Fort Payne Formation. The Muldraugh Member, like the Fort Payne, is a silty and cherty dolomite, but it contains smaller bodies of crinoidal limestone and some silty shale. The unit thins slightly to the northeast, and the underlying deltaic sediments thicken reciprocally (in central Kentucky). Near Mount Vernon, in Rockcastle County, the Muldraugh Member is very dolomitic and cannot be distinguished from the overlying units, the Salem and Warsaw Limestones and the lower part of the St. Louis Limestone, which have also thinned in this direction. Sandy and silty dolomite and limestone of these three units have been combined as the Renfro Member of the Borden Formation, which thus includes the interval from the top of the Wildie and Nada Members of the Borden Formation to the base of the Newman Limestone (fig. 12). </TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>341BOYL</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Boyle Dolomite</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Boyle consists of limestone, dolomite, and sandstone. The limestone is greenish gray to light gray or light olive gray and is composed of coarse-grained fossil fragments that weather white in a moderate-yellowish-brown or light-brown matrix of silt-sized calcite; the combination of colors results in a very pale yellowish brown to grayish orange appearance. The limestone contains some chert. The dolomite is grayish yellow to pale yellowish orange and moderate yellowish brown to dark yellowish orange; it contains some quartz sand and occurs near the base of the unit, as well as locally at the top, where the unit is thickest. In thin exposures, less than 1 ft. of limestone overlies as much as 1.3 ft. of dark-yellowish-orange calcareous sandstone, which contains a lag concentrate of sandstone pebbles as much as 2 inches in diameter as well as pyritic phosphatic debris. Beds in the unit are commonly 0.2 to 0.6 ft. thick in discontinuous sets 2 to 3 ft. thick; the unit is locally shaly weathering. Common fossils include crinoids, bryozoans, and horn corals. To the east, in the Stanford quadrangle, dolomite of the Boyle Limestone is light olive gray to light brownish gray and weathers on exposures to yellowish brown, olive gray, or olive black. Chert occurs in irregular layers and nodules, as much as 0.3 ft. thick, which are pale brown to medium gray and weather light gray to white. Original textures of the limestone are preserved locally and include oolites and fossil fragments. Cherty beds locally occur at the top of the Boyle, at the base of the Boyle, or throughout.&lt;br&gt;Subdivisions within the Boyle are valid for small areas and may be useful for some regional correlations. Variations in lithology, both areally and in vertical succession from place to place within the Boyle, preclude generalization. The Boyle Dolomite in Kentucky has also been called the “Corniferous” Limestone, the Onondaga Limestone, and the Hamilton Limestone.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Chattanooga shale</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Along Pine Mountain the lower part of the black shale sequence is everywhere cut by the Pine Mountain thrust fault. Here the thickness of the Devonian shale sequence preserved along the fault is as much as 1,000 ft. Where the Bedford Shale, Berea Sandstone, and overlying Sunbury Shale are mapped separately, mainly along the northern part of the fault, the unit includes only the Ohio Shale. To the southwest along the Pine Mountain exposures, where the Bedford thins and the Berea disappears, the black shale includes equivalents of the Sunbury Shale at the top and is called the Chattanooga. The eastward thickening of the Ohio and Chattanooga Shales in Pine Mountain is accompanied by an increase in the thickness and number of greenish-gray shale beds, an increase in the silt content of the shale, and an overall decrease in the organic content of individual black shale beds.&lt;br&gt;Correlations of subdivisions of the Ohio Shale with the New Albany and Chattanooga Shales has been facilitated by recognition of a widespread lithostratigraphic marker, the Three Lick Bed (Provo and others, 1978), as shown on the geologic map of the Levee quadrangle (McDowell, 1978). A biostratigraphic unit consisting of an abundance zone of the algae Foerstia (=Protosalvinia) was recognized by Schopf and Schwietering (1970). This zone occurs in the equivalents of the lower part of the Ohio Shale on the east side of the Cincinnati Arch and in the upper part of the New Albany Shale in the vicinity of Louisville (Kepferle, 1981). Correlations in the subsurface are facilitated by the use of wireline logs of drill holes. Gamma-ray logs are particularly useful in correlating organic-rich parts of the shale sequence (Wallace and others, 1977; Kepferle, Wilson, and Ettensohn, 1978). The marker beds described above have been keyed to the gamma-ray logs made of measured exposures (Ettensohn and others, 1979; Kepferle and others, 1981). Units recognized within the New Albany Shale in the Illinois Basin are summarized by Cluff and others (1981) for Illinois, Hasenmueller and Woodard (1981) for Indiana, and Schwalb and Norris (1980d) for Kentucky.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>New Albany Shale and equivalents</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The New Albany Shale is an organic-rich black shale that contains thin beds of greenish-gray shale in two zones, one near the top and the other near the base. In Jefferson and Oldham Counties, the New Albany is mapped separately and attains a thickness of 110 ft. It is mainly Late Devonian in age, although some of the lowermost beds in Madison County are Middle Devonian and the uppermost fraction of a foot to 25 ft. or so in exposures on the west side of the Cincinnati Arch is Early Mississippian. Fossils include the sporomorph commonly called Tasmanites, microfossils such as conodonts and radiolaria, carbonized and silicified wood fragments, fish scales, teeth, and bones, and linguloid and orbiculoid brachiopods. Trace fossils are common in the greenish-gray shale beds. Phosphatic nodules are locally common at or near the top of the shale. The New Albany Shale thins to the southeast from 110 ft. in Jefferson County toward the Cincinnati arch, where thickness ranges from 20 to 40 ft. The New Albany is continuous with the Chattanooga Shale southward in the Cumberland Saddle (area 2, fig. 7), where the shale locally thins to less than 4 ft. The New Albany thickens northeastward (area 3) to Olympia (Bath County). A tongue of Bedford Shale (Upper Devonian and Lower Mississippian) extends southwestward from Ohio into the upper part of the black shale sequence in this area; there the black shale is divided into the Sunbury Shale, 10 to 25 ft. thick, above the tongue and the Ohio Shale below the tongue (fig. 10). Northward, in Lewis County, the Ohio Shale reaches a thickness of 260 ft. and the Middle Devonian carbonates are missing beneath the black shale, which there lies on Middle Silurian dolomite.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>New Albany, Chattanooga, and Ohio Shales, Boyle Dolomite (Limestone), and Sellersburg Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Southward from Jefferson County, this unit consists of the Beechwood Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone and the overlying black New Albany Shale. Together they total less than 100 ft. thick, of which the Beechwood is less than 10 ft. The Beechwood lies above an unconformity that truncates successively older rocks southward to Marion County: the Silver Creek Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone and Jeffersonville Limestone (Early to Middle Devonian), and the Louisville Limestone, Waldron Shale, Laurel Dolomite, Osgood Formation, and Brassfield Dolomite (Early to Middle Silurian). In this area, the Beechwood is too thin or too discontinuous to delineate consistently on the quadrangle maps; therefore the unit has been mapped with the overlying New Albany Shale, although the Beechwood is separated from the New Albany by a locally distinct unconformity. In broad flat areas that make up the eastern part of the outcrop belt in these areas, residuum on thin remnants of the New Albany Shale is difficult to distinguish from the terra rossa of the weathered Beechwood.&lt;br&gt;The Boyle Dolomite and the Beechwood Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone are considered equivalent. The boundary between these units is arbitrarily placed along the northwest part of the Cumberland Saddle. In and near the faulted area of the saddle, however, the Boyle may include at its base equivalents of the Jeffersonville Limestone. The thickness of the Boyle is extremely variable and probably reflects irregularities on the surface on which it lies unconformably. The unit is thickest in the vicinity of the faulted area in south-central Kentucky, where as much as 60 ft of Boyle Dolomite has been mapped in the Stanford quadrangle, Lincoln County (Shawe and Wigley, 1974). The Boyle pinches out to the northeast on the east side of the Cincinnati Arch (area 3) and has not been mapped with certainty north of Fleming County. It is also missing beneath the Chattanooga Shale over a wide area in the southern part of the Cumberland Saddle. In the Raywick quadrangle, the Boyle thickens to 26 ft. in an erosional channel in the underlying shale of the Silurian Osgood Formation.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Beechwood Limestone Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Beechwood Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone is light gray to greenish gray; it weathers moderate yellowish brown, light to medium brown, and light olive gray. Fossil fragments and whole fossils are common in a micritic to sparry matrix and are characterized in part by distinctive three-vaned columnal plates of the crinoid commonly called Dolatocrinus; silicified fragments of brachiopods and horn corals are locally abundant where the formation has weathered to a chert-littered terra rossa. Reference sections and correlation are discussed by Orr and Pollock (1968), who follow Indiana usage (Patton and Dawson, 1955) in designating the unit a member of the North Vernon Limestone. The thickness in the vicinity of Louisville ranges from 2 to 11 ft. A lag concentration of phosphatic pebbles, quartz sand, pyrite, and glauconite occurs locally at the contact with the underlying unit, which in the vicinity of Louisville is either the Silver Creek Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone or the Jeffersonville Limestone. In Jefferson and Oldham Counties, the Beechwood is overlain unconfomably by the New Albany Shale.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>344JFVL</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Jeffersonville Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Jeffersonville Limestone consists mostly of olive-gray, brownish-gray, and medium- to light-gray fossiliferous limestone, which is in part dolomitic. Chert in thin irregular stringers has locally replaced the limestone; some of the fossils have been silicified. Stylolites are conspicuous in quarry exposures. The entire thickness of the Jeffersonville Limestone, 18 to 30 ft., is exposed in several abandoned quarries, along Interstate Highways I-71 and I-264, and along U.S. Highway 42 between Goose Creek and Little Goose Creek; the thickest exposures are at the Falls of the Ohio, where whole and broken fossils are conspicuous. The Jeffersonville Limestone pinches out beneath an unconformity southward against the northwest-facing flank of the northeast-trending Lyndon Syncline (Kepferle, 1974). Zonation of the unit based on fossils has been proposed by numerous workers, including, Oliver (1960), Perkins (1963), Stumm (1964, p. 7-9), and Conkin and Conkin (1972, p. 311—317). The detailed ecological relations of some of the corals in the Jeffersonville Limestone at the Falls have been studied by Kissling and Lineback (1967). Evidence of the shallow-water origin of the initial carbonates is provided by abundant large colonial corals in the basal part of the Jeffersonville Limestone.&lt;br&gt;The Jeffersonville is correlative with the Columbus Limestone of Ohio, the Onondaga Limestone of New York, the Huntersville Chert of the subsurface in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the Detroit River Group of northwestern Ohio and the Michigan Basin, the Grand Tower Limestone of Illinois, and, locally in south-central Kentucky, part of the Boyle Dolomite (Limestone) (Oliver and others, 1969).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Silver Creek Limestone Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Silver Creek Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone is bluish gray, olive gray, and light greenish gray on freshly exposed surfaces, and it weathers pale yellowish brown, yellowish gray, olive gray, and yellowish orange. It is fine-grained, clayey, dolomitic, and locally cherty, it tends to fracture to smooth conchoidal faces. Fossils are rare to abundant in sparse lenses, and include brachiopods such as Chonetes yandellanus, gastropods, pelecypods, and trilobites; bioturbation has imparted a mottled appearance. The contact with the underlying Jeffersonville Limestone is unconformable and locally is marked by phosphatic pebbles, quartz sand, pyrite, and glauconite. The unit is thickest on the Indiana shore of the Ohio River opposite McAlpine Dam, where as much as 15 ft. of limestone is preserved in individual beds. A complete thickness of 7.5 ft. is exposed along the north side of Interstate Highways I-71 and I-264, but the unit is locally missing between the overlying Beechwood Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone and the underlying Jeffersonville Limestone. The Silver Creek Limestone Member has not been identified where the Jeffersonville is missing, south of the vicinity of Louisville. The Silver Creek is correlated with the Stafford Limestone Member of the Skaneateles Formation (Hamilton Group of New York) by Oliver and others (1969).</TD>

It has a maximum thickness of about 100 ft at the Ohio River and thins to pinch-out about 10 mi to the south; it reappears locally southward beyond the pinch-out as thin erosional remnants.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Laurel Dolomite is composed 95 percent or more of gray dolomite with minor greenish-gray shale and sparse gray limestone. The Laurel is divisible into six remarkably persistent and distinct subunits throughout most of the outcrop belt (Peterson, 1981). The subunits are (1) a thinly interbedded dolomite and shale at the base, (2) a thin shale, (3) a vuggy-weathering dolomite, (4) a smooth-weathering dense dolomite, (5) a thin-bedded dolomite, and (6) a dolomite oolite at the top. Fossils, which are sparse to abundant, are commonly strongly dolomitized and poorly preserved. Recognizable forms include crinoid stems and columnals, brachiopods, and trilobites. The Laurel has a minimum thickness of about 40 ft.; maximum thickness ranges from about 55 ft. in the northern half of the outcrop belt to 65 ft in the southern half, where it is overlain by Waldron Shale and thus was not eroded before deposition of the Devonian rocks. The basal contact with the underlying Osgood Formation is gradational by interlayering of shale and dolomite through several inches to as much as 3 ft.</TD>

South of La Grange, most of the Louisville is finely crystalline calcitic dolomite; the sparse fossils are dolomitized and include crinoid columnals, brachiopods, horn corals, and colonial corals. North of La Grange, the Louisville is mostly a dolomitic limestone containing abundant, well-preserved whole and fragmental fossils, including horn corals, colonial corals, stromatoporoids, brachiopods, bryozoans, and crinoid columnals. The upper contact of the Louisville is a regional erosional unconformity or paraconformity. The maximum thickness, about 95 ft. occurs in a small area about 10 mi. southwest of Mount Washington; it is thinner to the north and south and is completely removed below the unconformity in the southern part of the western outcrop belt.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Waldron Shale is composed of greenish-gray shale and minor gray dolomite; probably at least 95 percent is shale. The shale is dolomitic and weathers with angular fracture or crude fissility, eventually producing a plastic clay. The dolomite is clayey and occurs in irregular masses, lumps, and thin discontinuous beds. Fossils, which are sparse in both the shale and the dolomite, include brachiopods, crinoid columnals, gastropods, and bryozoans. The Waldron Shale ranges in thickness from 9 to 15 ft. where overlain by the Louisville Limestone and not eroded prior to deposition of the Devonian sediments. The basal contact with the underlying Laurel Dolomite is conformable and sharp.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Brassfield Dolomite</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>South of Mount Washington, the Brassfield Dolomite is thin-bedded gray dolomite that contains nodules and discontinuous beds of chert, which probably constitute less than 5 percent of the formation, and a few thin beds of shale in the upper few feet. Glauconite is common in both the dolomite and the chert. Fossils, which occur in both the dolomite and the chert, are sparse to abundant and are generally indistinct and poorly preserved; they include brachiopods, crinoid columnals; horn corals, and colonial corals. The thickness ranges from about 10 to about 30 ft. where the entire formation is present.&lt;br&gt;North of Mount Washington, the Brassfield is much thinner and is composed of limestone, interbedded dolomite, and minor chert; here it has been called the Brassfield Formation. The limestone, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the formation, contains abundant crinoid columnals, brachiopods, bryozoans, and solitary and colonial corals. The dolomite is finely crystalline and unfossiliferous. The bedding tends to be irregular and disrupted. Glauconite is sparse to common in both the limestone and the dolomite. The Brassfield in this area ranges in thickness from 0 to about 10 ft. but is commonly 2 to 3 ft. thick.&lt;br&gt;The basal contact is an erosional unconformity of small relief, probably less than a few feet, over most of the western outcrop belt, but it may be conformable in a small area near Bardstown (Peterson, 1981).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Brassfield Dolomite</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Brassfield Dolomite is composed of thick- to thin-bedded gray dolomite with minor interbedded greenish-gray shale and, locally, chert nodules and lenses. The shale is more abundant in the upper part. Fossils are sparse to abundant and include crinoid columnals, brachiopods, horn corals, colonial corals, trilobites, pelecypods, and bryozoans. Gordon and Ettensohn (1984) have described the depositional environment of the Brassfield in eastern Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;The top of the Brassfield is distinct only south of Owingsville, Bath County, where the overlying Crab Orchard Formation is dominantly shale. North of Owingsville, dolomite beds are more abundant in the lower part of the Crab Orchard, and the top of the Brassfield, as characterized by fossils (the &quot;bead bed&quot; of some authors; see Gordon and Ettensohn, 1984, p. 105) at the type section, is not at a lithologic contact. Consequently, in the northern part of the outcrop belt a contact was mapped at the top of the dominantly dolomitic lower part of the Silurian section and the unit was labeled &quot;Lower part of Crab Orchard Formation and Brassfield Formation&quot; without specifying the top of the Brassfield.&lt;br&gt;The Brassfield Formation was reduced in rank to member, and a new formation, the Drowning Creek, was erected to reflect the units shown on the geologic quadrangle maps (McDowell, 1983, p. 7—11). The Drowning Creek Formation, described from exposures in Estill County, includes at the top dolomite members of the Crab Orchard Formation as used during the mapping program: Oldham Member south of Bath County and Dayton Dolomite Member to the north. This revision separates the Silurian of eastern Kentucky below the Bisher Dolomite into two mappable units of lithologic homogeneity: predominantly dolomite below and predominantly shale above (McDowell, 1983, p. 18).&lt;br&gt;The Brassfield ranges in thickness from about 9 to 28 ft. within the areas where the top can be definitely located and where it has not been truncated by the unconformity at the top of the Silurian.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Crab Orchard Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Crab Orchard Formation, as used during the mapping program, is composed mainly of greenish-gray clay shale with minor amounts of dolomite, which occur mostly near the base. In the southern part of the outcrop belt, south of Owingsville, the Crab Orchard is composed of five members, which are, from oldest to youngest, (1) Plum Creek Member, greenish-gray clay shale ranging from 2 to 12 ft. in thickness, (2) Oldham Member, gray fossiliferous dolomite interbedded with greenish-gray clay shale, which ranges in thickness from 3 to 15 ft., (3) Lulbegrud Shale Member, greenish-gray clay shale with minor amounts of dolomite which ranges in thickness from 2 to 21 ft., (4) Waco Member, interbedded greenish&#30;gray clay shale and lesser fossiliferous dolomite which range from about 2 to 13 ft. in thickness, and (5) Estill Shale Member, mainly greenish-gray clay shale, with a few brownish-gray, inch-thick, dolomite beds and lenses, which ranges in thickness from 60 to 170 ft. The Plum Creek, Oldham, and Lulbegrud Shale Members are not readily identifiable north of Owingsville, where the Waco Member pinches out. The basal beds of the Waco reappear 2 to 3 mi. northward, as the Dayton Dolomite Member, where they form the top of the dominantly dolomitic basal Silurian map unit now named the Drowning Creek Formation. The Estill Shale Member forms the upper part of the Crab Orchard in the northern part of the eastern outcrop belt. The Crab Orchard Formation is conformable with the underlying Brassfield Formation, and the contact south of Owingsville is sharp or gradational through a few inches.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Osgood Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Osgood Formation is composed of greenish-gray clay shale and gray clayey dolomite. Shale makes up about 90 percent of the unit, is commonly dolomitic, and weathers with a blocky fracture to a plastic clay; less commonly it is crudely fissile. The dolomite occurs in thin interbeds in the shale and is concentrated near the top and at the base. Where the entire unit is present the Osgood ranges in thickness from about 10 to about 50 ft. It is thickest near Bardstown and thinnest in the northern part of the outcrop belt. The basal contact appears to be gradational with the underlying Brassfield Dolomite through a few inches to a foot or so by interlayering of shale and dolomite south of Mount Washington, and is commonly sharp and apparently conformable to the north. Rexroad (1967), however, concluded on the basis of missing conodont zones that the Osgood and underlying Brassfield are separated by an unconformity.</TD>

The dolomite, mudstone, and siltstone are commonly unfossiliferous or very sparsely fossiliferous; the limestone is sparsely or moderately fossiliferous.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Grier Limestone Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>This member typically consists of sets of nodularly bedded fossiliferous calcisiltite to very poorly sorted fossiliferous calcarenite alternating with irregular beds of poorly sorted fossiliferous calcarenite. Shale partings are common. The member is characterized by abundant fossils, poor sorting, and bedding disrupted by bioturbation. The fauna are varied, but the most common fossils are brachiopods and bryozoans. The Grier contains an average of 0.8 percent P2O5 present as carbonate-fluorapatite. The phosphate mineral occurs as fillings in bryozoan zooecia, in pores of crinoid plates, and as steinkerns of ostracodes and minute gastropods. The Grier ranges in thickness from 100 ft. in Pendleton County to 180 ft. in westernmost Montgomery County.

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The High Bridge Group, shown as a single unit on the geologic map (Ohb), is the oldest stratigraphic unit exposed in Kentucky. It crops out south and west of Lexington in the gorge of the Kentucky River and the lower parts of its tributaries. The exposures extend from Frankfort in Franklin County, up the Kentucky River to Boonesboro, and up the Dix River to near Danville. The thickest section is near Camp Nelson south of Nicholasville, where 440 ft are exposed above river level. The High Bridge is restricted to Kentucky, although rocks of equivalent age and similar lithology are exposed in adjacent States.&lt;BR&gt;The character, stratigraphy, and depositional environments of the High Bridge Group have been described at length by Cressman and Noger (1976). The High Bridge Group comprises three formations; these are, in ascending order, the Camp Nelson Limestone, the Oregon Formation, and the Tyrone Limestone. These formations were mapped separately for the geologic quadrangle maps and will be described separately. The Camp Nelson has been correlated with the Lebanon Limestone, and possibly part of the Ridley Limestone of central Tennessee, and with the Witten Limestone, and possibly part of the Wardell Formation of Cooper and Prouty (1943) of southwestern Virginia and northeastern Tennessee; the Tyrone has been correlated with the upper member of the Carters Limestone of central Tennessee and with the Cane Creek Formation of Cooper (1956) of southwestern Virginia and northeastern Tennessee (Cressman and Noger, 1976, p.3).</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365LOGN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Logana Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>In most of its area of exposure, the Logana Member consists of three parts: (1) a lower unit of interbedded calcisiltite and shale, (2) a middle coquinoid limestone consisting of closely packed shells of the brachiopod Dalmanella sulcata, and (3) an upper, thinner unit of interbedded calcisiltite and shale. The calcisiltite is generally in even or broadly lenticular beds 0.2 to 0.3 ft. thick and is mostly unfossiliferous, though pelecypods and scattered Dalmanella are present in some beds. The member is about 50 ft. thick in Pendleton County but thins southward to a feather-edge that extends northeastward from Harrodsburg in Mercer County. The thinning results largely from lateral gradation of the upper part into fossiliferous limestone of the Grier Limestone Member but also, in part, from gradation of the lower part into the Curdsville Limestone Member. The Logana was deposited during the culmination of the initial transgression of Lexington time.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Lexington Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The lithostratigraphy and depositional environments of the Lexington Limestone (Ol) were described by Cressman (1973), and the following discussion has been drawn largely from that account.&lt;BR&gt;The Lexington Limestone consists mostly of very fossiliferous and fossil-fragmental limestone that contrasts strikingly with the micrite-rich, sparingly fossiliferous rocks of the High Bridge Group. The Lexington is more than 320 ft thick along a line that extends from 10 mi. north of Frankfort eastward through Georgetown and Paris. It thins northward from this line to 190 ft. in Pendleton County, westward to about 200 ft in Shelby County, and southward to about 220 ft. near Danville in Boyle County. The thinning results mostly from intertonguing of the upper part of the Lexington with the lower part of the Clays Ferry Formation, as illustrated by the generalized stratigraphic sections of the Lexington Limestone. Intertonguing of the two formations was shown on the geologic quadrangle maps, but the contact is generalized on the State geologic map by necessity of the scale.&lt;BR&gt;Outcrop of the Lexington Limestone in Kentucky is limited to the Inner Bluegrass region.  Lateral equivalents of the Lexington in adjacent States have been described by Freeman (1953), Wilson (1949, 1962), and Cressman (1973). The interval in general contains less limestone and more shale to the north and west; the Nashville Group to the south differs principally in a change in facies trends from east-west to north-south (Cressman, 1973, p. 55).&lt;BR&gt;The Lexington Limestone comprises 12 members which are described below.

Bryozoans, brachiopods, mollusks, and trilobite fragments are particularly abundant, and stromatoporoids and colonial corals are present in some zones. The Millersburg closely resembles in character the Grier Limestone Member, though it contains much more shale, and, like the Grier, the Millersburg averages 0.8 percent P2O5. The Millersburg is 90 ft. thick in western Montgomery County and thins to a featheredge north of Cynthiana in Harrison County, near Frankfort, and near the Kentucky River south of Lexington. The thinning results largely from a facies change; northward the Millersburg intertongues with the Clays Ferry Formation, and westward and southward it passes into the Tanglewood Limestone Member. The Millersburg was deposited on a shallow bank that occupied what is now the central part of the Inner Bluegrass. Light, agitation, and circulation on the bank supported abundant life.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365NLSN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Camp Nelson Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Camp Nelson Limestone is dominantly micrite, pelmicrite, and biopelmicrite, all containing abundant subhorizontal dolomite-filled burrows that impart a ropy appearance to bedding surfaces. Mollusks, brachiopods, and bryozoans are present, though not in great abundance. About 320 ft. of the formation are exposed near Camp Nelson.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365ORGN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Oregon Formation</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Oregon is characterized by yellowish-gray thick-bedded finely crystalline dolomite that in much of the area is interbedded with limestone. The thickness of the formation ranges from 6 ft in its southernmost exposures near the south end of Herrington Lake to 65 ft. near Boonesboro. The base of the Oregon is at about the same stratigraphic position throughout its outcrop area, and the thickening of the formation results from dolomite beds occurring higher in the section to the northeast. The dolomite is horizontally laminated and exhibits mud cracks and mud-chip breccias, indicating that the sediments were originally tidal-flat deposits.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365PRVL</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Perryville Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>This member is present in the southwestern part of the Inner Bluegrass region. It forms a wedge that thickens to the southwest from a featheredge 5 mi northeast of Harrodsburg to about 50 ft. at Perryville in Boyle County. The thickening results from a facies change; the Perryville passes northeastward into calcarenite of the lower part of the Tanglewood Limestone Member, and the calcarenite, in turn, passes into fossiliferous limestone of the Grier Limestone Member. The Perryville consists of two major rock types. The first is brownish-gray calcisiltite in rough-surfaced beds. Mollusks, tabulate corals, and stromatoporoids dominate the fauna. Algal-coated fossil fragments are common. The second is light-gray calcilutite, some of which contains tubiform burrows and some of which is horizontally laminated. The member was deposited in quiet, restricted water in the lee of a band of calcarenite bars.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365SLPW</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Sulphur Well Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>In the southwestern part of the Inner Bluegrass, the Brannon Member is overlain, mostly disconformably, by as much as 35 ft. of limestone that contains extremely abundant bryozoans. This bryozoan limestone is the Sulphur Well Member. The northern edge of the Sulphur Well is in central Jessamine, southern Woodford, and Anderson Counties, from where it grades northward into part of the Tanglewood Limestone Member; southward it intertongues with the basal part of the Clays Ferry Formation.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365SPGG</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Stamping Ground Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Stamping Ground Member is a unit of nodular fossiliferous limestone and shale as much as 15 ft. thick that is very similar in lithology to both the Greendale Lentil and the Millersburg Member but is continuous with neither. The member crops out in a band about 5 mi. across that extends from south of Paris in Bourbon County through Georgetown to southern Henry County. The Stamping Ground is underlain and overlain by, and passes laterally into, calcarenite of the Tanglewood Limestone Member. A conspicuous zone of stromatoporoids is present in the upper part of the member throughout most of its area of exposure. The Stamping Ground is not shown on the generalized stratigraphic sections.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Strodes Creek Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Strodes Creek (Black and Cuppels, 1973) crops out east of a line from Cynthiana to Winchester. It is both underlain and overlain by the Millersburg Member. It consists of brownish-gray bioturbated calcilutite and calcisiltite and characteristically contains abundant stromatoporoids and sparse but conspicuous ostracodes. It represents deposition in waters more sheltered than those of the Millersburg.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365TLGD</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Tanglewood Limestone Member</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Tanglewood is an extensive irregular body of fossil-fragmental calcarenite that makes up much of the upper part of the Lexington Limestone in the Inner Bluegrass region. The member intertongues with the Clays Ferry Formation and with all other members of the Lexington Limestone except the Curdsville Limestone and Logana Members. The calcarenite is typically well sorted and crossbedded. It contains an average of 2.4 percent P2O5, though the amount varies greatly from bed to bed. The phosphate grains are similar to those in the Grier Limestone Member but have been reworked, rounded, sorted, and concentrated by currents. The Tanglewood was deposited on the shallowest parts of the shelf, where waves and currents could break, abrade, and sort skeletal material, and on bank margins, where tidal currents would have attained maximum velocity.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>365TYRN</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Tyrone Limestone</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>This formation ranges in thickness from 55 to 155 ft. The thicknesses of the Tyrone and the underlying Oregon Formation are complementary: where the Tyrone thickens, the Oregon thins. The Tyrone consists of a variety of limestone types. Most common are (1) interlaminated micrite and dolomite displaying abundant mud cracks, (2) laminated micrite with fenestral fabric and mud cracks, (3) micrite containing abundant vertical tubiform burrows, (4) micrite containing abundant fragments of the tabulate coral Tetradium, (5) crossbedded biopelsparite, (6) bioturbated biopelmicrite, and (7) micrite with dolomite-filled burrows similar in appearance to much of the limestone of the Camp Nelson. Types 1 through 3 were deposited in tidal flats, whereas types 4 through 7 were deposited in shallow marine areas.&lt;br&gt;The Tyrone Limestone in central Kentucky contains at least five potassium bentonites. These are the Mud Cave bentonite of drillers at the top of the formation, the Pencil Cave of drillers 16 to 30 ft below the top, and three unnamed bentonites about 15, 55, and 65 ft. below the Pencil Cave. Both the Mud Cave and Pencil Cave bentonites are locally as much as 2 ft. thick, but the others are generally only a few inches thick. The lower three bentonites are discontinuous and the Mud Cave was removed from much of the area by erosion, but the Pencil Cave is present throughout nearly all of the outcrop area. It can be identified in the subsurface north to the Ohio River and south to the Tennessee border; it is widely distributed in the Central basin and the Sequachie Valley of Tennessee as the T-3 bentonite of Wilson (1949, p. 64). The Pencil Cave is the bentonite shown on the stratigraphic column for east-central and west-central Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;Following deposition of the Tyrone Limestone, the High Bridge strata were gently arched and slightly eroded. along an east-west axis about 10 mi. north of Lexington; as much as 10 ft. of the uppermost Tyrone was removed (Cressman, 1973, p. 12). Subsequent marine transgression from the north and west initiated deposition of the Lexington Limestone.</TD>

<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Pp1</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>Peridotite intrusives</TD>
<TD DIR=LTR ALIGN=LEFT>The Elliott County peridotite (Pp.), represented by three small red outcrop areas on the State geologic map, is shown on the Willard quadrangle (Brown, 1977). It occurs as three separate elongate intrusive bodies 1/4. to 1/2 mi in length and a few hundred feet in width, within an area of about a square mile. The rock is a dark-green peridotite (kimberlite) composed of serpentinized olivine and a number of accessory minerals, including phlogopite, pyrope, calcite, enstatite, and others. Xenoliths, mainly of shale, and igneous rock inclusions are abundant in the three intrusive bodies (Brown, 1977). Detailed petrographic descriptions of the peridotite are presented by Diller (1887) and Bolivar (1982).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Permian intrusive rocks also occur in western Kentucky. The lamprophyre and peridotite dikes and sills (Pl) in the western Kentucky fluorspar district, which are discussed in a summary report by Trace and Amos (1984), are shown on seven geological quadrangle maps. A total of 39 separate bodies are shown on these maps, and most of these are included on the State geologic map as red lines or outcrop symbols. Most of the bodies (24) are located in the Salem quadrangle; a few are mapped on the basis of drill data (Cave In Rock and Lola quadrangles). The dikes and sills range in length from a few yards to as much as 3.5 mi, if the two outcrops labeled &quot;Hobby dike&quot; in the Crider quadrangle are a single continuous dike, and range in thickness from a few inches to as much as 75 ft (Warren, 1956). Most strike northwesterly or northerly. The dikes are typically dark gray to dark greenish gray, fine to medium grained, and slightly porphyritic; they are composed of biotite, serpentine, chlorite, phlogopite, olivine, pyroxene, calcite, dolomite, and a number of opaque accessory minerals (Trace and Amos, 1984, p. 29). The rock is generally highly weathered.</TD>
