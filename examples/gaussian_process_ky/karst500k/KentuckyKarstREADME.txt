The Karst Occurrence GIS polygon coverages for Kentucky were compiled 
from a digital version of the 1:500:000-scale geologic map of Kentucky 
(Noger, M.C., 1988).  Because of the 1:500,000 scale of the source map, 
these coverages should NOT be used for evaluating karst geologic 
hazards or hydrogeology at scales larger than 1:500,000.  The 
classification of the potential for karst development was based on 
the field experience of the authors and other data.  A number of 
isolated carbonate units were newly digitized for these coverages.
