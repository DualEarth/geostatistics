# geostatistics
Basic concepts and demonstrations for learning geostatistics. This repository contains resources for geostatistical analysis, including kriging, variograms, Bayesian methods, and spatial interpolation.

## Repository Structure

- **lesson/** - Collection of notes, scripts, and exploratory code covering various geostatistical concepts.
- **examples/** - Cleaned-up and structured code demonstrating geostatistics applications.
- **environment/** - Conda environment setup and tools needed to run the code.

## Data Source

### 
This website has 3,425 datasets to look through: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=geology](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=geology)!, many of which would be good for geostatistics examples.

### Data for examples
- **Kentucky Oil & Gas Production**  
USGS Dataset with locations of production oil and gas wells: [https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/664b5d86d34e1955f5a47206](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/664b5d86d34e1955f5a47206)!
